## Supported Databases

PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, and SQLite.

## Why DBHub?

DBHub brings powerful database capabilities to AI coding assistants:

- **Token Efficient**: Just two general MCP tools (execute_sql, search_objects) to minimize context window usage, plus support for custom tools
- **Multi-Database**: Single interface for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, and SQLite
- **Secure Access**: Read-only mode, SSH tunneling, and SSL/TLS encryption support
- **Multiple Connections**: Connect to multiple databases simultaneously with TOML configuration
- **Production-Ready**: Row limiting, lock timeout control, and connection pooling

## Key Features

### Database Exploration

AI assistants can discover and explore your database schema:
- List schemas, tables, and columns
- View table structures and relationships
- Inspect indexes and stored procedures
- Understand database constraints

### SQL Execution

Execute SQL queries directly from AI tools:
- Run SELECT queries for data analysis
- Execute DDL/DML in read-write mode
- Support for parameterized queries
- Multi-statement execution with transaction support

### AI Assistant Capabilities

DBHub enables AI assistants to:
- Generate optimized SQL queries
- Explain database elements and relationships
- Suggest schema improvements
- Debug complex queries

### Security Features

- **Read-only Mode**: Restrict operations to SELECT queries only
- **SSH Tunneling**: Secure connections through bastion hosts
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypted database connections
- **Row Limiting**: Prevent accidental large data retrieval

### Admin Console

Monitor and manage your database connections through the built-in admin console:
- View all configured data sources
- Track recent SQL requests
