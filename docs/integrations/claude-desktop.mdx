## Overview

Claude Desktop can connect to DBHub via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to interact with your databases through natural language.

## Configuration

Add DBHub to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
    Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "dbhub": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "@bytebase/dbhub",
            "--transport",
            "stdio",
            "--dsn",
            "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "dbhub": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "@bytebase/dbhub",
            "--transport",
            "stdio",
            "--dsn",
            "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Demo Mode

For testing, you can use the built-in demo database:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbhub": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@bytebase/dbhub",
        "--transport",
        "stdio",
        "--demo"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using DBHub in Claude Desktop

After configuration:

1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Look for the 🔌 icon indicating MCP servers are connected
3. Ask questions like:
   - "Show me all tables in my database"
   - "What are the top 10 customers by revenue?"
   - "Explain the schema of the users table"

## Troubleshooting

### DBHub not connecting

- Verify your DSN connection string is correct
- Check that the database is accessible from your machine
- Review Claude Desktop logs: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log` (MacOS)

### Permission errors

- Ensure your database user has appropriate permissions
- Consider using `--readonly` flag for safer queries
