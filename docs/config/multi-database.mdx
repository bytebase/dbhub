title: "Multi-Database"
---

Connect to multiple databases from a single DBHub instance using TOML configuration. Useful for:
- Managing production, staging, and development databases
- Working with databases across different cloud providers
- Querying multiple database types simultaneously

## Configuration

Create a `dbhub.toml` file:

```toml dbhub.toml
# Database sources
[[sources]]
id = "production"
dsn = "postgres://user:password@prod.example.com:5432/myapp"

[[sources]]
id = "staging"
dsn = "mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/myapp_staging"

[[sources]]
id = "local"
dsn = "sqlite:///./dev.db"

# Tool configuration
# Production: read-only execute_sql with row limit, plus search_objects
[[tools]]
name = "execute_sql"
source = "production"
readonly = true    # Tool-level setting: restrict to read-only queries
max_rows = 1000    # Tool-level setting: limit result set size

[[tools]]
name = "search_objects"
source = "production"

# Staging: full access with higher row limit
[[tools]]
name = "execute_sql"
source = "staging"
max_rows = 5000    # Tool-level setting: higher limit for staging

[[tools]]
name = "search_objects"
source = "staging"

# Local: default tools (both execute_sql and search_objects)
# No [[tools]] entries = both tools enabled by default with no restrictions
```

Start DBHub:

```bash
# Automatically loads ./dbhub.toml
npx @bytebase/dbhub@latest --transport http --port 8080

# Or specify custom location
npx @bytebase/dbhub@latest --config=/path/to/config.toml
```

See [TOML Configuration](/config/server-options#toml-configuration) for detailed option descriptions and [Tool Configuration](/tools/overview#tool-configuration) for controlling which tools are available per source.
