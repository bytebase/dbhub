MCP is drowning in builders but starving for users. PostgreSQL has millions of users but few new tools being built. 
The intersection—Postgres MCP server—is where both problems get solved. When Anthropic launched MCP in November 2024, 
Postgres was among the original six reference implementations. A year later, with MCP now joined by OpenAI, Google, and
Microsoft, the question is: which Postgres MCP server should you choose?

## The Contenders

If you are looking for a Postgres MCP server, you are likely searching by GitHub star count. These four have the most (as of Dec 20, 2025):

- **[MCP Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox)** (11.8k stars) — Google's MCP Toolbox supporting multiple databases with OAuth, connection pooling, and OpenTelemetry observability.
- **[Supabase MCP](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp)** (2.3k stars) — Built for the Supabase ecosystem, offering deep platform integration including edge functions, migrations, and branching.
- **[DBHub](https://github.com/bytebase/dbhub)** (1.7k stars) — Bytebase's minimal, token-efficient server supporting multiple databases including Postgres.
- **[Postgres MCP Pro](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp)** (1.6k stars) — Crystal DBA's performance-focused server with index tuning, query plan analysis, and database health monitoring.

| Server | Maintainer | License | Language |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|
| MCP Toolbox for Databases | Google | Apache-2.0 | Go |
| Supabase MCP | Supabase | Apache-2.0 | TypeScript |
| DBHub | Bytebase | MIT | TypeScript |
| Postgres MCP Pro | Crystal DBA | MIT | Python |


Let's dig into each from four dimensions:

1. **Installation** — How easy is it to get started?
1. **Tools** — What capabilities does the server expose?
1. **Token Efficiency** — How much context does the server consume?
1. **Auth & Security** — How does it handle authentication and security?
