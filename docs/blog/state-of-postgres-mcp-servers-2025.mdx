MCP is drowning in builders but starving for users. PostgreSQL has millions of users but few new tools being built.
The intersection—Postgres MCP servers—is where both problems get solved. When Anthropic launched MCP in November 2024,
Postgres was among the original six reference implementations. A year later, with MCP now adopted by OpenAI, Google, and
Microsoft, let's take a look at the current landscape.

## SQL Injection Upgraded

Remember SQL injection? Untrusted user input mixed with SQL commands, executed by the database. Prompt injection is the same problem, one layer up: untrusted user input mixed with AI instructions, executed by the LLM.

In July 2025, a [Supabase MCP vulnerability](https://www.generalanalysis.com/blog/supabase-mcp-blog) proved this isn't theoretical. The attack: embed SQL commands in a support ticket, let an AI assistant read it, watch it execute with full database access and exfiltrate data.

Simon Willison called it the ["lethal trifecta"](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/)—access to private data + exposure to untrusted content + ability to externally communicate in one tool. Supabase added read-only defaults and protective prompting, then admitted **"prompt injection is generally an unsolved problem."** The [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44502318) consensus: asking LLMs nicely isn't a security boundary.

Every Postgres MCP server ships with unfixable vulnerabilities. The question is what limits the damage:

- **Read-only by default**
- **Least privilege credentials**
- **Separation of environments**
- **Audit logging**
